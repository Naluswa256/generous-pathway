                      "The idea for SIC came to me when I visited my childhood village after completing my education," 
                      John recalls. "I found many children without parents, being raised by elderly grandparents who 
                      were struggling to provide for them. Many of these children had lost their parents to HIV/AIDS, 
                      and their grandparents were doing their best with very limited resources."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      What began as a small initiative to provide school supplies to orphaned children has grown into 
                      a comprehensive organization addressing multiple community needs. John's vision expanded when he 
                      observed that many people with disabilities in the community lacked access to assistive devices 
                      and opportunities for economic independence.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p className="mb-4">
                      "I realized that sharing resources, knowledge, and opportunities could transform lives," says John. 
                      "That's where our name comes fromâ€”the simple but powerful principle that sharing is indeed caring."
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                      Today, SIC works across Uganda, providing education for orphans, assistive devices and skills 
                      training for people with disabilities, and healthcare and support for elderly caregivers. 
                      John's leadership has been recognized nationally and internationally, earning him several 
                      humanitarian awards for his dedication to community service.
